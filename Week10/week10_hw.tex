\begin{document}
\maketitle

Create a R source file that does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Imports a data set of your choosing on which you will be able to perform both an OLS and logistic regression
\item Cleans the data and sets up one continuous(ish) dependent variable, one binary variable, and at least three independent variables.
\item Runs an OLS regression and displays the results
\item Runs a logistic regression and displays the results
\end{enumerate}

I won't post a key (since week10.R basically does the above). If you have trouble getting your script to run, send me an email, attaching your source file and dataset, and I can help troubleshoot.
