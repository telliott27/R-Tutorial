\begin{document}
\maketitle

Create a source file that does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Import the hire771.dta Stata dataset
\item Print the first 10 rows of the data frame
\item Create a new variable within the data frame that is a factor variable of sex. Value labels of the factor should be  ``male'' and ``female.'' Check that the new variable was created correctly by comparing the original sex variable with the new one using the \texttt{table()} command.
\item Rename the original sex variable to ``male.''
\item Create a new variable in the data frame that is a factor variable of ethnic. The value labels should match those in the codebook. Check that the new variable is correct with \texttt{table()}.
\item Create a dummy variable for ``African-American'' in the data frame
\item Create a categorical variable from salary where salaries below 100 are labeled ``Low,'' salaries between 100 and 200 are labeled ``Medium,'' and salaries above 200 are labeled ``High.''
\item Save the modified data frame in a new R data file.
\end{enumerate}
