\begin{document}
\maketitle

Create a R source file that does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Imports the Dynamics of Collective Action Dataset
\item Keeps only the variables eventid, year of the event, and smoname1-4
\item Reshape this data to long, so that each SMO name appears on its own row
\item Download and import pci.csv, which contains yearly per capita income for the twentieth century.
\item Merge per capita income onto the reshaped DOCA data, so that each event contains the PCI for the year the event took place. Make sure you do not have extra rows from years that do not appear in DOCA.
\item List out the first ten rows of the new data frame.
\end{enumerate}
